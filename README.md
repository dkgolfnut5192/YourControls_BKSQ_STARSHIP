# Made for MSFS2020 and not validated for 2024
Thanks to @Tailhook for helping with H EVENT door issue

# Version 0.3
  * - KNOWN ISSUES in MSFS2020
  - Doesn't work good in "Ready to Fly" Spawning on Runway unless you reset Generators as mentioned below. 
  - Generators require you flip them OFF, On, Reset for them to handle load correctly. A reset may work, but I moved it to OFF>ON>RESET>ON
  - FMS ENTRY OPTIONS
   - 1 - FMS CDU entry using the built in CDU #'s and Letters for Route entry is synchronized to the second pilot.
   - 2 - Keyboard entry (using your keyboard) into the FMS CDU needs to be completed when not connected via YC's and must be entered on both CDU's manually. Otherswise Key strokes are not synched to second pilot except the initial airport. 
  - Toggle type Momentary switches like AHRS REINIT, FASTSLAVE, GND ICE DEETR TEST, ETC. do not sync based on O EVENT needed
  - BREAKERS ARE NOT SYNCHED

# - FIXES:
  - 6/28/2025
   - Added Door lighting panel (Located near Main Entry) Switches for CABIN, AISLE, ENTRY and DOOR
   - Fixed Door sync issue by ignoring the CabinDoor H EVENT
  - 6/22/2025
   - Fixed STORM LIGHT SWITCH
   - COM AUDIO VOLUME and most switches on Audio panel 1 and 2 are non functional Due to Developer
   - Initial release for Beta testing 6/21/2025

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
